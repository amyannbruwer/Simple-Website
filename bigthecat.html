        <h1> Hello I'm Big the Cat! </h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Big the Cat is a fictional character from the Sonic the Hedgehog series. He is a large,
            anthropomorphic purple cat who lives deep within Mystic Ruins. Though imposing of stature, Big is a gentle
            and
            easy-going, though somewhat dim-witted person with a heart of gold. He also possesses incredible strength
            and toughness
            that makes him one of Sonic the Hedgehog's strongest allies. He is also an expert fisherman.

            Big spends most of his time fishing in tranquility with his best friend, Froggy. Not one for going on grand
            adventures,
            Big prefers his peaceful and quiet lifestyle in the jungle. However, should his friends be in danger or in
            need of his
            aid, Big will not hesitate to leave his home to help them out and protect them in any way he can.
            Big is a very large and burly anthropomorphic cat. The majority of his body fur is purple with dark violet
            stripes. A
            striped pattern runs up his arms and long tail. His feet are covered in dark violet fur up to his ankles as
            well as the
            outer tips of his large, triangular ears, while his upper legs, back, and sides are covered in purple fur.
            White fur
            covers his chest, torso, muzzle, and inner ears. He also has black eyes with pale yellow sclera.

            His preferred attire consists of yellow gloves, sandals, and a matching belt with a gold buckle. He usually
            keeps his
            fishing rod with him.
