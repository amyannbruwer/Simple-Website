        <h1> Hi I'm Sonic the Hedgehog! </h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Sonic the Hedgehog, is the titular main protagonist of the
            Sonic the Hedgehog series and Sega's mascot. He is an anthropomorphic hedgehog born with the ability to run
            faster than
            the speed of sound, hence his name, and possesses lightning-fast reflexes to match his speed. As his species
            implies,
            Sonic can also roll up into a concussive ball, primarily to attack enemies.

            Ever since stepping into the battle against iniquity, Sonic has been the champion of peace and is renowned
            all over the
            world for saving it countless times. During his many adventures, Sonic has traveled from the ends of the
            world to the
            far reaches of space and time, facing countless trials that have tested him to the fullest, earning him many
            titles,
            allies, and the scorns of several foes. Well-known for his legendary cocky attitude, easy-going demeanor,
            and somewhat
            short temper, yet strong sense of justice, compassion, and love for freedom and adventure, Sonic uses his
            abilities to
            protect the innocent from his world and those beyond from the forces of evil, especially his arch-nemesis,
            Dr. Eggman,
            and his empire.
