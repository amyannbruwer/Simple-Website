                Amy Rose, also known as Rosy the Rascal, is a fictional character
                that appears in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. She is an anthropomorphic hedgehog with a major crush on Sonic the
                Hedgehog. Since meeting Sonic on Little Planet, Amy has become his self-proclaimed girlfriend and has attempted to win
                his heart by any means during their adventures. She wields the Piko Piko Hammer, a powerful melee weapon which she uses
                with skills second to none and never leaves home without.
                Amy is a cheerful, though slightly erratic girl, with a positive attitude and boundless energy. However, she has a scary
                temper and her infatuation with Sonic makes her shortsighted and a bit obsessive about him, having followed him
                everywhere since meeting him. Nevertheless, she has a pure heart and will not let anything stop her.
